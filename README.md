# README -- Code The Dream Backend Additional Topics

This repository contains the framework for a Rails application called customer-order. Unfortunately the Treehouse videos do not cover some critical
skills required of Rails developers.  Therefore we have developed additional material and presentation slides to cover these key subjects.

After you clone the repository, create a new branch called validations, and put your work there.  When you complete the section on Additional Subjects,
push your validations branch to github and create a pull request.  Then create a new branch called rspec, for the section on Rails Testing with RSpec.
When you complete that section, push your work to github again, and create a pull request.  Then create a new branch called full-assignment, for the
class section on a complete assignment.  Once you finish that, you push the full-assignment branch to github and create another pull request.  Typically each
of these sections will be assigned in separate weeks.
